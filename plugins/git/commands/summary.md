description: Show current branch, git status, and recent commits for quick context
---

Show me a concise git summary for the current repository including:

1. Current branch and tracking status (ahead/behind remote)
2. Git status (modified, staged, and untracked files)
3. Last 5 commits with one-line summaries
4. Any uncommitted changes summary

Format the output clearly so I can quickly understand the current state of the repository.
